# MyNodejsExpress_backend

This project is the backend-only version of my [TIN_project](https://github.com/D34THNOTE/TIN_Project) work, the scope of this project is limited to the back-end server handling communication with the database, it includes a stylized view on http://localhost:3000/ when running

To run:
1. Clone the repository
2. (While Docker application is running) Using command line type "docker-composte up" when in the directory that has this file(included in the repository)
3. Make sure that the created databases are running, specifically make sure that MySQL database on the port 3306 has been launched properly
4. While in the cloned repository run "npm start" command in the command line
